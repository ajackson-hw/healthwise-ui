## Healthwise UI Core

Core is the base library of UI building blocks components. They are generic, not Healthwise-specific, so you may find them useful in many projects.

### Usage within your React component:

#### Import
> import  Input  from  '@healthwise-ui/core/InputText'

> `<Input label="Fave Num" type="number" defaultValue="3" />`
